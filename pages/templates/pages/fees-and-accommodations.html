      This is a one-time fee that is due within 10 days of submitting the school registration
      form and reserving the countries your school would like to represent.
      <br/> <br/>
      For schools registering between October 15 - November 17, the fee is $100.
      <br/>
      For schools registering between November 18 - January 24, the fee is $125.
      <br/><br/>
      <b>One school = One school fee.</b>
    </p>

    <h4>Delegate Fee</h4>
    <p>
      This is a fee that is paid per delegate registered.
      This payment is due January 24th and is a flat rate of <b>$65/delegate</b>.
      The individual delegate registration form will be sent to schools once their school fee has been received.
      <br/> <br/>
      <b>One delegate = One delegate fee.</b>
      <br/> <br/>
      These fees help us in booking venues, producing conference materials, providing catered food, purchasing valuable
      conference supplies, and much more. If you have any questions regarding fees or how they are spent, please contact
